This folder contains Matlab scripts using the C#-Java interface to communicate with the DSP.ConnectToCSH.m	This script demonstrates loading the assemblies generated by Visual Studio. The test connects to the DSP, configures a filter and sends harmonics through the filters and measure the output, calculating the gain. The resulting gain is plotted in a semilogarighmic plot as a function of frequency.
